# Good ReadMe Generator

This is a simple command-line application that automatically generates a README.md from the information that the user provides. The user will be prompted for their GitHub username. Through this, we will make a call to the GitHub API to retrieve their email and profile image. They will further be prompted on information that should be added inside their readme file.
